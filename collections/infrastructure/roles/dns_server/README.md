# DNS server

## Description

This role provides a dns server based on bind.

## Instructions

This DNS role will automatically add networks of the cluster defined in the Ansible inventory,
assuming their variable **dns_server** is set to true:

```yaml
networks:
  ice1-1:
    subnet: 10.11.0.0
    prefix: 16
    netmask: 255.255.0.0
    broadcast: 10.11.255.255
    dhcp_server: true
    dns_server: true  <<<<<<<<<<
    services_ip:
      dns4:
        - ip: 10.11.0.1
```

It will generate 5 files:

* `/etc/named.conf` that contains main configuration, and that will try to bind to all networks defined on the host it is deployed on, using **services_ip.dns_ip** variable ip of the network.
* `/var/named/forward` that contains forward resolution of hosts
* `/var/named/forward.soa` included by /var/named/forward
* `/var/named/reverse` that contains reverse resolution of hosts
* `/var/named/reverse.soa` included by /var/named/reverse

To configure forwarding and integrate this dns server into an existing IT
configuration, set variable `dns_server_forwarders` as a list of target forwarders.

```yaml
dns_server_forwarders:
  - 8.8.8.8
```

To optionally override the IP addresses returned by certain host you can define `dns_server_overrides` variable, like the following content for example:

```yaml
dns_server_overrides:
  0.uk.pool.ntp.org: 10.11.0.1
```

In this example, DNS look-ups for *0.uk.pool.ntp.org* will return *10.11.0.1*.

This will cause `/var/named/override` to be generated.
