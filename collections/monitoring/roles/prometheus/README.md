## 1. Description

This role deploys Prometheus (server/client) with related ecosystem:

* Prometheus (scrap metrics, store them, evaluate alerts)
* Alertmanager (manage alerts by grouping them, sending mails, etc)
* Karma (a dashboard for AlertManager)
* Am-executor
* ipmi_exporter
* snmp_exporter
* other exporters:
   * slurm_exporter
   * node_exporter
   * ...
* Custom exporter python modules

The role provides a basic configuration that should match 80% of the cluster's
needs. An advanced configuration for specific usages is available and described
after the basic part.

## 2. General instructions

You can refer to this diagram to help understanding of the following readme.

![File not found](resources/global_schema.svg "Main role schema")

### Server or/and client

**Server part** of the role deploys Prometheus, Alertmanager, Karma, Am-executor,
ipmi_exporter, snmp_exporter, and their respective configuration files and
service files.

To install server part, set `prometheus_server` to `true` at role invocation
vars. See server configuration bellow for more details.

**Client part** of the role deploys other exporters or custom exporter
python modules on clients.

To install client part, set `prometheus_client` to `true` at role invocation
vars. See client configuration bellow for more details.

**Important**: while server related variables are dedicated to server
configuration, client variables are used by **both** client and server part of
the role.

### Default ports

* Prometheus is available by default at http://localhost:9090
* Alertmanager is available by default at http://localhost:9093
* Karma is available by default at http://localhost:8080 (admin / admin)

## 3. Basic Server configuration

Playbook example:

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy prometheus server
  hosts: mg_managements
  roles:
    - role: prometheus
      vars:
        prometheus_server: true
```

In the basic usage, the server role will install and setup the following tools:

* Prometheus: scrap and store metrics, fire alerts.
* Alertmanager: manage alerts fired by Prometheus.
* Karma: dashboard to monitor alerts managed by Alertmanager.
* Am-executor: trigger actions in case of alert fired. (**Am-executor is still not implemented**)
* ipmi_exporter: translate ipmi data to http scrapable by Prometheus.
* snmp_exporter: translate snmp data to http scrapable by Prometheus.

Which means all of these services will, by default, be running on the same
management host.

To manage what server part of the role should install and setup, defaults
variables can be used. The following variables, with their default values shown
here, are available:

```yaml
prometheus_server_manage_prometheus: true
prometheus_server_manage_alertmanager: true
prometheus_server_manage_karma: true
prometheus_server_manage_am_executor: false
prometheus_server_manage_ipmi_exporter: false
prometheus_server_manage_snmp_exporter: false
```

### Prometheus configuration

#### Scraping

By default, role will inherit from values set in its defaults folder.
You may wish to update these values to your needs, as these values set the
different timings used by Prometheus.

To do so, create file *inventory/group_vars/all/prometheus.yml* with the
following content (tuned to your needs, all global values can be defined):

```yaml
prometheus_server_configuration_global:
  scrape_interval: 1m
  scrape_timeout: 20s
  evaluation_interval: 2m
```

To understand the meaning of these values, refer to:

* https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config
* https://www.robustperception.io/whats-the-difference-between-group_interval-group_wait-and-repeat_interval

If you do not set a value, Prometheus will use its defaults values, described
in the main documentation.

**Warning**: size your storage available for Prometheus database according to
the size of the cluster and the scrape_interval set here.

These timings will apply to all exporters scraping. It is however possible to
tune specific timings for each exporter. This part is covered in the client
section of this readme.

#### Alerting

It is key to understand that in the Prometheus ecosystem, alerts are calculated
and fired **by Prometheus** and not Alertmanager. Alertmanager is a tool to
managed alerts that were fired by Prometheus (group alerts, send emails, etc).

By default, the role will only add a simple alerts file into the
/etc/prometheus/alerts folder. This file contains very basic alerts related to
exporters down or Prometheus own scraping.

The role also offers to install few other alerts, each related to a specific exporter.
To install these additional alerts, simply enable them by adding them in the
**prometheus_server_additional_alerts** list variable. The following additional
alerts are available:

```yaml
prometheus_server_additional_alerts:
  - ipmi_exporter
  - node_exporter
```

You will probably wish to add more alerts. You can add more files in the
/etc/prometheus/alerts directory, and these will be loaded by Prometheus at
startup.

To do so, either add them manually using another role
(like [generic psf](https://github.com/bluebanquise/community/blob/main/roles/generic_psf)), or
add them in the inventory by adding their YAML code in the file
*inventory/group_vars/all/prometheus_alerts.yml*. For example:

```yaml
prometheus_server_custom_alerts: !unsafe >
  groups:
    - name: user alerts
      rules:
      - alert: HostOutOfMemory
        expr: node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes * 100 < 10
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Host out of memory (instance {{ $labels.instance }})"
          description: "Node memory is filling up (< 10% left)\n  VALUE = {{ $value }}\n  LABELS: {{ $labels }}"
      - alert: HostOutOfInodes
        expr: node_filesystem_files_free{mountpoint ="/rootfs"} / node_filesystem_files{mountpoint="/rootfs"} * 100 < 10 and ON (instance, device, mountpoint) node_filesystem_readonly{mountpoint="/rootfs"} == 0                              
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Host out of inodes (instance {{ $labels.instance }})"
          description: "Disk is almost running out of available inodes (< 10% left)\n  VALUE = {{ $value }}\n  LABELS: {{ $labels }}"
```

### Alertmanager configuration

Alertmanager parameters are highly depending of users wishes.
Considering that, it is difficult to not propose a fully customizable parameters
file. This is why AlertManager whole configuration is contained in a single
variable, called **prometheus_server_alertmanager_raw_configuration**. The default
content is the following:

```yaml
prometheus_server_alertmanager_raw_configuration:
  global:
    smtp_smarthost: 'localhost:25'
    smtp_from: 'alertmanager@your_domain'
    smtp_require_tls: false

  route:
    group_by: ['alertname', 'job']
    group_wait: 1m
    group_interval: 10m
    repeat_interval: 3h
    receiver: sys-admin-team

  receivers:
    - name: 'sys-admin-team'
      email_configs:
        - to: 'sys-admin-team@bluebanquise.com'

  inhibit_rules:
  - source_match:
      severity: 'critical'
    target_match:
      severity: 'warning'
    equal: ['alertname', 'cluster', 'service']
```

If you wish to tune the content of this file, simply copy this variable in the
inventory and tune it according to your needs.

To understand meaning of these values, refer to [main documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/)
or to [this page](https://www.robustperception.io/whats-the-difference-between-group_interval-group_wait-and-repeat_interval).

### Karma configuration

Few Karma parameters can be defined if needed.

To set karma username and password, use:

```yaml
prometheus_server_karma_username: admin
prometheus_server_karma_password: admin
```

Default is admin / admin.

## 4. Basic Client configuration

Playbook example:

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy prometheus server
  hosts: mg_managements
  roles:
    - role: prometheus
      vars:
        prometheus_client: true
```

The client side of the role simply install and start local exporters on nodes.

### Exporters

Each exporter has its own http port. For example, node_exporter is available at
http://localhost:9100 .

Both server and client side of the role share the same variables for exporters.

Two main variables are available:

* `prometheus_exporters_to_scrape`
* `prometheus_exporters_groups_to_scrape`

Both variables are very similar.

`prometheus_exporters_to_scrape` is used by server side only. Exporters listed
here will be scraped by Prometheus using defined `address` and `port`.
Exporters listed here have to be installed manually or with another role/task since
client side of the role will not consider them.

```yaml
prometheus_exporters_to_scrape:
  - name: slurm_exporter
    scrape_interval: 1m
    scrape_timeout: 30s
    address: 10.10.7.11
    port: 9817
  - name: ha_cluster_exporter
    scrape_interval: 1m
    scrape_timeout: 30s
    address: 10.10.7.11
    port: 9664
```

`prometheus_exporters_groups_to_scrape` is used by both server and client sides.
Server side will scrap these exporters on all the nodes of the group, while
client side will install them on all nodes of the group.

It is important to understand that the client side of the role is capable of 
generating everything needed by an exporter binary: service file, users, working dir, etc.
The role will generate these elements depending of the variables present.
The list of capabilities is described after the example.

Note that if port is not present, server side will ignore the exporter, but
client side will install and start it. This can be used to install
`prometheus_exporters_to_scrape` in HA context.

```yaml
prometheus_exporters_groups_to_scrape:
  equipment_management:
    - name: node_exporter
      service: node_exporter
      package: node_exporter
      port: 9100
  equipment_login:
    - name: node_exporter
      package: node_exporter
      service: node_exporter
      port: 9100
      user: node_exporter
      group: node_exporter
      home: /var/lib/node_exporter
      uid: 950
      gid: 950
    - name: login_exporter
      package: login_exporter
      service: login_exporter
      scrape_interval: 1m
      scrape_timeout: 30s
      port: 9122
```

Note here that **scrape_interval** and **scrape_timeout** are optional
values for each exporter here. These will override default values only if set.

The following actions can occur:

* If group is defined, a group will be created for the exporter (and set as default group in service file)
* If gid is defined and group is defined, the group created will have this gid
* If user is defined, a user will be created for the exporter (and set as default user in service file)
* If uid is defined and user is defined, the user created will have this uid
* If package is defined, the corresponding package will be installed (should be exporter binary)
* If service is defined, a systemd service file will be generated and service will be started.
* If service is defined, a corresponding /etc/{{service}} folder will be created if not exist
* If port is defined, the port will be opened in the firewall if firewall is up

## 5. IPMI and SNMP

ipmi_exporter and snmp_exporter behave differently: they act as translation
gateways between Prometheus and the target. Which means, if you wish for example
to query IPMI data of a node, you do not install the exporter on the node itself.
You query the ipmi_exporter, which will itself query the target for IPMI data.
This is why, in the basic configuration, these two exporters are installed by
the server part of the role and not the client part.

To have the exporter installed by the server part of the role, set their
respective variables to true or false, according to your needs:

```yaml
prometheus_server_manage_ipmi: true
prometheus_server_manage_snmp: false
```

You then need to specify which equipment_profile groups of nodes have to be
ipmi scraped. To do so, simply set the global variable `prometheus_ipmi_scrape_equipment_profiles` 
in the default *inventory/group_vars/all/prometheus.yml* file:

```yaml
prometheus_ipmi_scrape_equipment_profiles:
  - name: equipment_management
    scrape_interval: 5m
    scrape_timeout: 2m
  - name: equipment_login
  - name: equipment_compute
```

This will add these into prometheus targets configuration for scraping via
ipmi_exporter.

Note that you can set custom scrape_interval and scrape_timeout for ipmi or snmp
using dedicated variables shown in the example above.

Note also that ipmi_exporter will need `ep_equipment_authentication` dictionary
to be set for each equipment_profile that needs ipmi data scraping.

## 6. Advanced usage

### Set custom launch parameters

Since Prometheus ecosystem has been originally designed to run into containers,
some major parameters are passed to the binary at launch. This is why the current
role generate the systemd service file to integrate custom launch parameters.

The following variables, with their default values shown here, are available
to tune launch parameters of each tool:

```yaml
prometheus_server_launch_parameters: |
  --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
  --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
  --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries $PROMETHEUS_OPTIONS

alertmanager_launch_parameters: |
  --config.file=/etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml

karma_launch_parameters: |
  --config.file=/etc/karma/karma.yml

ipmi_exporter_launch_parameters: |
  --config.file=/etc/ipmi_exporter/ipmi_config.yml

snmp_exporter_launch_parameters: |
  --config.file=/etc/snmp_exporter/snmp.yml
```

For example, to manipulate data retention (default 15 days) and ask for 60 days,
set this variable:

```yaml
prometheus_server_launch_parameters: |
  --storage.tsdb.retention.time 60d \
  --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
  --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
  --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries $PROMETHEUS_OPTIONS
```

Note that with recent version of Prometheus, you can also set the data base
maximum size instead. See more at https://www.robustperception.io/configuring-prometheus-storage-retention .

Another example, to manipulate database path, combine with a 60 days retention,
set:

```yaml
prometheus_server_launch_parameters: |
  --storage.tsdb.pat /prometheus \
  --storage.tsdb.retention.time 60d \
  --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
  --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
  --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries $PROMETHEUS_OPTIONS
```

Etc. See all available options at https://gist.github.com/0x0I/eec137d55a26a16d836b84cbc186ab52 .

### Manipulate firewall

On some system, you may wish that the whole server side ecosystem is reachable
from the network or not (you may wish to reach it using an ssh port forwarding
only for example).

If variable `prometheus_firewall_open` is set to `true`, Prometheus and AlertManager will be reachable from the network on the `prometheus_server_firewall_zone` defined (default public). If not, firewall ports related to both will remain closed.

Example:

```yaml
prometheus_firewall_open: true
prometheus_server_firewall_zone: internal
```

Regarding client side, variable **prometheus_client_firewall_zone** allows to
set the firewall zone to be open for exporters to listen for queries.

### Splitting services

For some specific configurations, it is needed to split services over multiple
hosts.
For example to force ipmi_exporter and/or snmp_exporter to be deployed on
another host than the one running Prometheus.

To do so, disable ipmi and snmp on the hosts running Prometheus (host1), using this
configuration as host1 dedicated hostvars :

```yaml
prometheus_server_manage_prometheus: true
prometheus_server_manage_alertmanager: true
prometheus_server_manage_karma: true
prometheus_server_manage_am_executor: false
prometheus_server_manage_ipmi_exporter: false
prometheus_server_manage_snmp_exporter: false
```

And activate them on the host you wish them to run (host2), using the opposite values for host2 dedicated hostvars:

```yaml
prometheus_server_manage_prometheus: false
prometheus_server_manage_alertmanager: false
prometheus_server_manage_karma: false
prometheus_server_manage_am_executor: false
prometheus_server_manage_ipmi_exporter: true
prometheus_server_manage_snmp_exporter: true
```

To ensure everyone can communicate, set now these global variables in
group_vars/all (these variables are all set to localhost by default):

```yaml
prometheus_server_prometheus_host: host1
prometheus_server_alertmanager_host: host1
prometheus_server_karma_host: host1
prometheus_server_am_executor_host:
prometheus_server_ipmi_exporter_host: host2
prometheus_server_snmp_exporter_host: host2
```

This can be used to spread all main services.

Note: if any `prometheus_server_manage_X` variable is not defined, it is considered `false`.

Warning: if your firewall is running, you may need to open ports for desired
services.

### Adding raw prometheus.conf scraping jobs:

It is possible to inject raw scraping jobs into the
prometheus.conf file using the following multi lines variable:

```yaml
prometheus_server_prometheus_raw_jobs:
```

Note that you can combine this part and the [generic psf](https://github.com/bluebanquise/community/blob/main/roles/generic_psf)
role to create advanced configurations, like High Availability with Virtual IP.

### Adding raw prometheus.conf configuration

It is possible to inject raw prometheus configuration parameters into the
prometheus.conf file using the following multi lines variable:

```yaml
prometheus_server_prometheus_raw_configuration:
```

### TLS and/or Basic Authentication

To enable TLS encryption, you need to set these variables:

```yaml
prometheus_server_enable_tls: true
prometheus_server_tls_cert_file: 
prometheus_server_tls_key_file: 
```

To enable basic authentication, you need to set these variables:

```yaml
prometheus_server_enable_basic_auth: true
prometheus_server_basic_auth_user: 
prometheus_server_basic_auth_password: 
prometheus_server_basic_auth_hash_password: 
```

Note: You can use python3-bcrypt to generate hashed password. See more at https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/basic-auth/#hashing-a-password .

To load web configuration file, use the --web.config.file flag:

```yaml
prometheus_server_prometheus_launch_parameters: |
  --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
  --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
  --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries $PROMETHEUS_OPTIONS \
  --web.config.file=/etc/prometheus/web.yml
```
