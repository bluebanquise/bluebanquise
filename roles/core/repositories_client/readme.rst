Repositories client
-------------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This role simply configure repositories for client hosts.

Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

See repositories_server role instructions for general repositories path details.

Repositories are set in **repositories** variable. Two shapes are available: a
simple one and an advanced one.

Simple one:

.. code-block:: yaml

  repositories:
    - os
    - bluebanquise
    - myrepo

Advanced one, to be combined with simple one as desired:

.. code-block:: yaml

  repositories:
    - os
    - bluebanquise
    - name: epel
      baseurl: 'https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/$releasever/$basearch/'
      proxy: 'https://proxy:8080'

Available advanced variables are:

* name
* baseurl
* enabled
* exclude
* gpgcheck
* gpgkey
* proxy

CentOS
""""""

Since the content of the ISO DVD is copied in the os/ directory of the
repository server, this role disable CentOS default repositories.

For CentOS 7, all repositories *base*, *updates* and *extras* are disabled and
replaced by the *os* repo.

For CentOS 8, instead of disabling the default OS repositories *BaseOS* and
*AppStream*, the role will update the repo configuration to use paths
*.../os/BaseOS/* and *.../os/AppStream/*. The role still disables the *Extras*
repository which is enabled by default but not shipped with the ISO DVD. If one
need to add the *Extras* repo, it is advised to add it to the inventory like
any other repository.

.. code-block:: yaml

  repositories:
    - Extras
    - bluebanquise
    - os

There is a use case of people running CentOS 7 with a local clone of the *base*
repository but still using the online *updates* repository. You can keep this
behaviour by adding this repo to the external_repositories parameter in your
inventory. Please consider using the mirror closest to your location.

.. code-block:: yaml

  external_repositories:
    - name: "CentOS-Updates"
      baseurl: "http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/updates/x86_64/"
      gpgcheck: 1
      gpgkey: "file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7"

Note that the `update repository does not exist anymore in CentOS 8
<https://wiki.centos.org/FAQ/CentOS8#I_don.27t_see_the_updates_repo_for_CentOS-8>`_.

Input
^^^^^

Mandatory inventory vars:

**hostvars[inventory_hostname]**

* repositories[item]

Optional inventory vars:

**hostvars[inventory_hostname]**

* external_repositories[item]

Output
^^^^^^

Repositories are set.

To be done
^^^^^^^^^^

Need to clear up the Ubuntu repositories process, still not clear how to handle
own made repos and officials repos as Ubuntu add local repos everywhere in the
sources.list file.
