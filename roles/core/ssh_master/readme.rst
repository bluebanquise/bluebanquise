SSH master
----------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This role configures the ssh access of inventory known hosts to ensure ssh access through nodes main network.

Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This role will generate a configuration file in */root/.ssh/config*.

This file will contains all hosts of the Ansible inventory (or all hosts of the
current iceberg if using icebergs mode), with the following parameters:

.. code-block:: text

  Host freya
      Hostname %h-ice1-1

And possibly add :

.. code-block:: text

    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null

If asked for.

Note that for this example host, **freya**, the target hostname for ssh is
%h-ice1-1, which translates to **freya-ice1-1**. This can be seen when invoking
ssh with verbosity:

.. code-block:: text

  [root@odin ]# ssh freya -vvv

You can see here ssh is not trying to reach **freya** but is using
**freya-ice-1-1**. This has been made to ensure whatever the direct resolution
is in /etc/hosts or DNS, ssh and so Ansible will always use the management
network of the target host.

Also, keep in mind that when redeploying a host its SSH key changes, which
requires to remove the former host key from the known_hosts file, then add the
new key. It is possible to achieve this with the commands below:

.. code-block:: bash

  # for host in $(nodeset -e $NODES); do \
      sed -i -e "/^${host}/d" /root/.ssh/known_hosts; \
  done
  # clush -o '-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no' -w $NODES dmidecode -s system-uuid

It is possible to disable the strict host key checking in the inventory with the
configuration below:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   security:
     ssh:
       hostkey_checking: false

This was the default behaviour prior BlueBanquise 1.3. The ssh configuration
file will include the following parameters:

.. code-block:: text

  Host freya
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
      UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
      Hostname %h-ice1-1

This ensure no issues when redeploying an host, at the cost of security.

Note that this file generation is kind of "sensible", and will surely be the
first one to break in case of uncoherent inventory. If this happens, check your
inventory, fix it, and remove manually /root/.ssh/config and relaunch its
generation.

Input
^^^^^

Mandatory inventory vars:

**hostvars[hosts]**

* network_interfaces[item]

Optional inventory vars:

**hostvars[inventory_hostname]**

* security.ssh.hostkey_checking

Output
^^^^^^

/root/.ssh/config file

To be done
^^^^^^^^^^

Add ProxyJump for icebergs
