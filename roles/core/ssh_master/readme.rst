SSH master
----------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This role configures the ssh access of inventory known hosts to ensure ssh access through nodes main network.

Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basic usage
"""""""""""

This role will generate a configuration file in */root/.ssh/config*.

This file will contains all hosts of the Ansible inventory (or all hosts of the
current iceberg if using icebergs mode), with the following parameters:

.. code-block:: text

  Host freya
      Hostname %h-ice1-1

And possibly add :

.. code-block:: text

    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null

If asked for.

Note that for this example host, **freya**, the target hostname for ssh is
%h-ice1-1, which translates to **freya-ice1-1**. This can be seen when invoking
ssh with verbosity:

.. code-block:: text

  [root@odin ]# ssh freya -vvv
  OpenSSH_7.8p1, OpenSSL 1.1.1 FIPS  11 Sep 2018

  debug2: resolving "freya-ice1-1" port 22
  debug2: ssh_connect_direct
  debug1: Connecting to freya-ice1-1 [10.11.2.1] port 22.

You can see here ssh is not trying to reach **freya** but is using
**freya-ice-1-1**. This has been made to ensure whatever the direct resolution
is in /etc/hosts or DNS, ssh and so Ansible will always use the management
network of the target host.

Also, keep in mind that when redeploying a host its SSH key changes, which
requires to remove the former host key from the known_hosts file, then add the
new key. It is possible to achieve this with the commands below:

.. code-block:: bash

  # for host in $(nodeset -e $NODES); do \
      sed -i -e "/^${host}/d" /root/.ssh/known_hosts; \
  done
  # clush -o '-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no' -w $NODES dmidecode -s system-uuid

It is possible to disable the strict host key checking in the inventory with the
configuration below:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   security:
     ssh:
       hostkey_checking: false

This was the default behaviour prior BlueBanquise 1.3. The ssh configuration
file will include the following parameters:

.. code-block:: text

  Host freya
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
      UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
      Hostname %h-ice1-1

This ensure no issues when redeploying an host, at the cost of security.

Note that this file generation is kind of "sensible", and will surely be the
first one to break in case of uncoherent inventory. If this happens, check your
inventory, fix it, and remove manually /root/.ssh/config and relaunch its
generation.

Multiple iceberg usage
""""""""""""""""""""""

The ssh_master role allows to enable ssh ProxyJump to ssh from a top iceberg to 
hosts of a sub_iceberg, through one master of the sub_iceberg.
This allows simple central point to ansible-playbook.

To activate this feature, enable it first by adding in your inventory the 
variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

  ssh_master_enable_jump: true

By default, the first management found in the group list of the sub_iceberg 
will be used as ssh ProxyJump target. It is possible to manually override this, 
in case of HA and virtual IP for example, by defining in the sub_iceberg variables 
the desired target.

For example, to force ProxyJump target to be 10.10.0.77 for 
iceberg3 hosts, in inventory/cluster/icebergs/iceberg3 file, add 
ssh_master_iceberg_jump_target:

.. code-block:: text

  [iceberg3:vars]
  iceberg_master = iceberg1
  iceberg_level = 2
  ssh_master_iceberg_jump_target = 10.10.0.77

In case of issue, try adding verbosity to the ssh invocation to investigate (-vvv).
