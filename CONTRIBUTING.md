You will find here some basic guidelines to contribute.

## Reporting bugs

If you encounter any bug, please open an issue.
An issue template is generated when creating a bug issue. Try to comply with it to fasten my answer.

I may ask you more questions then, or even to provide part of your inventories.
Feel free to refuse, I will **never** take offense.

Do not provide security related data (ssh key, passwords, etc) in your reports.

## Asking for new features / enhancements

If you need new features, please open an issue using the feature request template.

## Pull Requests

All contributions must pass through a Pull Request, to ensure easy reviewing of modifications.

I will then do my best to answer you and test your contribution as soon as possible, before merging it.
I may iterate with you to converge before merging to master branch.

## License

The stack is under MIT. This choice is based on a wish to allow everyone to use it.
Please consider using the same license if you wish to Pull Request some code into the main project.
