# Contributing

:construction_worker: Many thanks for considering contributing to **BlueBanquise**. :construction_worker:

Please do not hesitate to contact me using [issues](https://github.com/bluebanquise/bluebanquise/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/bluebanquise/bluebanquise/discussions), I will be glad to help you! :raising_hand:

Please keep in mind I am developing BlueBanquise as a **best effort** on my free personal time.

You will find here some basic guidelines to contribute.

## Conventions

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
and commits adheres to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Whenever possible, I try to comply with these conventions.

## Reporting bugs

If you encounter any bug, please open an issue.
An issue template is generated when creating a bug issue. Try to comply with it to fasten my answer.

I may ask you more questions then, or even to provide part of your inventories.
Feel free to refuse, I will **never** take offense.

Do not provide security related data (ssh key, passwords, etc) in your reports.

## Asking for new features / enhancements

If you need new features, please open an issue using the feature request template.
Try to comply with it to fasten my answer.

## Pull Requests

All contributions must pass through a Pull Request, to ensure easy reviewing of modifications.

I will then do my best to answer you and test your contribution as soon as possible, before merging it.
I may iterate with you to converge before merging to master branch.

### Versioning

By default, each role has a version number, set in vars/main.yml and at the bottom of the readme.rst or README.md.
If your PR brings changes to the tasks, files, templates or vars folders, please increment the version.

## License

The stack is under MIT. This choice is based on a wish to allow everyone to use it.
Please consider using the same license if you wish to Pull Request some code into the main project.
