This is an attempt to better organise devs logs

2024-09-23: Fix Ubuntu 24 support in pxe_stack
2024-09-21: Add Ubuntu 24 support in pxe_stack
2024-09-21: Fix multiple small issues in pxe_stack
2024-09-21: Fix version of ansible-core to 2.16.11 max, to prevent issues with Python 3.6 OS
2024-09-18: Remove Kofi sponsor, add UNICEF link.
2024-09-18: Starting from ansible-core 2.17, mandatory python version on client side is 3.7.
            RHEL 8 and OpenSuse Leap 15 brings Python 3.6 by default.
            Now PXE will automatically install Python 3.11 on both OS to allow Ansible discoverer to uses these versions.
            Note that only OpenSuse 15.6 brings Python 3.11 in the ISO for PXE, making it a mandatory minor version.
