## The stack

**BlueBanquise** is an **Ansible** based stack, designed to deploy and manage large group of hosts.

Main target is High Performance Computing, but stack is generic and can adapt to any kind of architecture (University or Enterprise network, render farm, etc.).

Currently supported OS are:

* Fully supported:
  * RedHat/Centos 7
  * RedHat/Centos 8

* In development:
  * OpenSuse Leap 15.1

* To be included if demand:
  * Ubuntu
  * Debian

Ansible >= 2.8.2 is mandatory for BlueBanquise to run properly.

**[OpenHPC](https://openhpc.community/downloads/)** scientific packages and OpenHPC slurm job scheduler are compatible with the stack.

BlueBanquise is part of the **Algoric** Project from the [**Fabrique du Loch**](https://www.lafabriqueduloch.org/fr/accueil/) FabLab.
