BlueBanquise is an Ansible based stack, designed to deploy and manage large group of hosts.

Main target is Hight Performance Computing, but stack is generic and can adapt to any kind of cluster architecture.

It is a revamp of old Banquise stack.

BlueBanquise is part of the **Algoric** Project from the **Fabrique du Loch** FabLab.
