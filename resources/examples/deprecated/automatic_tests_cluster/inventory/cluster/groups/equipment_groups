# Equipment groups correspond to the hardware of nodes
# Most of the time, one equipment profile group is created for each different kind of  hardware
# However, in some cases, user may have to define multiple equipment profiles for a single 
# hardware, for example if multiple OS configuration are possible.
# Equipment groups are free to be renamed, keeping prefix equipment_
