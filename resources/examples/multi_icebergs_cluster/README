This examples is composed of 3 icebergs.

One top iceberg, iceberg1, composed of:

* 1 management node
* 1 storage node
* 2 login nodes
* 1 security node

Nodes are connected on the 10.1.0.0 subnet on this iceberg.

Two slaves icebergs.

iceberg2 with:

* 1 management node
* 4 compute nodes

Nodes are connected on the 10.2.0.0 subnet on this iceberg.

iceberg3 with:

* 1 management node
* 2 compute nodes on ice3-1 network
* 2 gpu compute nodes on ice3-2 network

Nodes are connected on the 10.3.0.0 and 10.4.0.0 subnets on this iceberg.

Each iceberg as an isolated ethernet network. Each slave iceberg management have
on nic on its iceberg network, and one nic on its top iceberg network.

All nodes are connected through a shared interconnect.
