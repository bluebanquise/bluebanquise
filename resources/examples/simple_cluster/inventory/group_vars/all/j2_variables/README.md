# BlueBanquise internal j2_ variables.

These files contains j2 variables.

:rotating_light: DO NOT EDIT THEM!!!! :rotating_light:

Only edit if you know what you are doing.

If a variable does not provide the correct output, or not the desired one, do not edit it, but use Ansible variables precedence mechanism to force your own value, as these j2_ variables are at the bottom of precedence priority.
