Welcome on BlueBanquise main documentation. You should find here all needed 
information on how to deploy and use the BlueBanquise stack.

Since one of the main BlueBanquise goals is also to be a training for new Linux system 
administrators, part of the documentation is generic knowledge and act 
as a tutorial for basic cluster deployment and basic Ansible usage. Advanced users 
can skip these parts.

These pages contain information on:

* How to manually deploy a test HPC cluster (generic knowledge, not related to the stack)
* How to use Ansible (generic knowledge, not related to the stack)
* How to bootstrap, configure, deploy and maintain BlueBanquise on different scenario clusters
* Detailed documentation on each roles provided with the stack

`Please report us <https://github.com/bluebanquise/bluebanquise/issues>`_ any
issues in this documentation.

Please proceed to :ref:`Introduction` to start.
