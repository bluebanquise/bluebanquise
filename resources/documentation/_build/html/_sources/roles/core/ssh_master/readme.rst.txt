SSH master
----------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This role configure the ssh access of know hosts to make this access through nodes main network.

Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This role will generate a Configuration file in */root/.ssh/config*.

This file will contains all hosts of the Ansible inventory (or all hosts of the current iceberg if using icebergs mode), with the following parameters:

.. code-block:: text

  Host freya
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
      UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
      Hostname %h-ice1-1

This ensure no issues when redeploying an hosts.

Also, note that for this example host, **freya**, the target hostname for ssh is %h-ice1-1, which means **freya-ice1-1**. This can be seen when invoking ssh with verbosity:

.. code-block:: text

  [root@odin ]# ssh freya -vvv

  debug2: ssh_connect_direct
  debug1: Connecting to freya-ice1-1 [10.11.2.1] port 22.

You can see here ssh is not trying to reach **freya** but is using **freya-ice-1-1**. This has been made to ensure whatever the direct resolution is in /etc/hosts file or DNS, ssh and so Ansible will always use the management network of the target host.

Note that this file generation is kind of "sensible", and will surely be the first one to break in case of uncoherent inventory. If this happens, check your inventory, fix it, and remove manually /root/.ssh/config and relaunch its generation.

To be done
^^^^^^^^^^

Add ProxyJump for icebergs
