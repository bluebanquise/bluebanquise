========================
Install first management
========================

First step to deploy **BlueBanquise** is to install first management node manually.

Install operating system
========================

Install Centos 7.6 using parameters you need.

The following parameters are recommended:

* >= 2 CPU/vCPU
* >= 2 Gb RAM
* >= 16Gb HDD

And the following parameters are the stricti minimal if you whish to test the stack in VMs:

* >= 1 vCPU
* >= 512 Mb RAM
* >= 6Gb HDD

In this last configuration, DVD iso will be mounted from /dev/cdrom instead of being copied to save space.

It is recommanded to only choose minimal install during packages selections. Also, it is recommanded to let system in English, and only set your keyboard and time zone to your contry.

Prepare system for Ansible
==========================

Once system is installed and rebooted, login, and disable firewall. Current stack do not support firewall configuration (but it is scheduled for later released).

.. code-block:: bash

  systemctl stop firewalld
  systemctl disable firewalld
