==========
Vocabulary
==========

Lets establish few common terms between us before going deeper in technical
details.

Some words are important in **BlueBanquise**. Most of them are described here.

Ansible vocabulary
==================

Host
----

An Ansible **host** (also often referred as a **node**) is a remote host managed
by Ansible. An **host** can be a physical server, but also a VM or something
else.

Hosts are defined in */etc/bluebanquise/inventory/cluster/nodes*.

Please do a difference between an Ansible managed host, and a host.
All equipment that can have an ip address on the network are considered "host",
but only those with an ssh + python capability and on which we will use Ansible
to deploy a configuration are considered "Ansible managed host".
They are declared the same way in the stack inventory.

Group
-----

An Ansible **group** is a logical aggregation of hosts.
For example, system administrator can define a group "database_servers" that
would contain hosts "database1" and "database2".

**Groups** allow Ansible to provide dedicated **variables** to member hosts or
execute tasks on a set of hosts.

Note: a host can be part of multiple groups.

Variables
---------

Variables in Ansible follow the YAML structure.

A variable is like in any programming language: a variable name, and a data
related.

Multiple kind of variables exist in Ansible:

Simple
^^^^^^

A simple variable is defined this way:

.. code-block:: yaml

  my_variable_1: hello!
  my_variable_2: 7777

In Jinja2, variables will be accessible directly this way:

.. code-block:: text

  {{ my_variable_1 }}

Output will be:

.. code-block:: text

  hello!

List
^^^^

A list is like an array, and can be iterated over:

.. code-block:: yaml

  my_names_list:
    - bob
    - alice
    - henry

In Jinja2, variables in a list can be iterated over, or a specific value of the
list can be used (like an array):

.. code-block:: text

  {% for i in my_names_list %}
  {{ i }}
  {% endfor %}
  {{ my_names_list[0] }}

Note that index start at 0.

Output will be:

.. code-block:: text

  bob
  alice
  henry
  bob

Note also that to check if a list is empty,
it is possible to check the list itself:

.. code-block:: text

  {% if my_names_list %}
  the list is not empty
  {% else %}
  the list is empty
  {% endif %}

Dictionary
^^^^^^^^^^^

A dictionary, is simply a pack of other variables, organized as a tree, and
defined under it (some kind of variables tree):

.. code-block:: yaml

  my_dictionarry_1:
    my_variable_1: hello!
    my_variable_2: 7777
    my_sub_part:
      color: yellow
      font: verdana
    my_names_list:
      - bob
      - alice
      - henry

In Jinja2, dictionary can be access two ways:

.. code-block:: text

  {% for i in my_dictionarry_1.my_names_list %}
  {{ i }}
  {% endfor %}
  {% for i in my_dictionarry_1['my_names_list'] %}
  {{ i }}
  {% endfor %}

  {{ my_dictionarry_1.my_names_list[0] }}
  {{ my_dictionarry_1['my_names_list'][0] }}


Output will be:

.. code-block:: text

  bob
  alice
  henry
  bob
  alice
  henry

  bob
  bob


Jinja2 will be discussed later, do not worry about this point for now.

j2 Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are **BlueBanquise** specific variables.
All variables with name starting by **j2_** are j2 variables.

These variables are all stored in internal/group_vars/all/j2_variables
directory, and are used for the internal purpose of the stack.

These variables are here to simplify tasks and templates writing, and centralize
main logic of the stack.
To clarify your mind, you can consider that these variables contain Jinja2 code
as a string, that will be interpreted by Ansible during tasks/templates
execution.

Remember that in any case, if these variables are not providing the expected
value, you can use Ansible variables precedence mechanism to force your values.

Last point, for developers, these j2 variables should be considered as a way to
keep compatibility with roles, while upgrading the logic of the stack. Do not
hesitate to use them in roles, to ensure long term compatibility.

Inventory, roles, and playbooks
-------------------------------

Inventory
^^^^^^^^^

The Ansible inventory is the directory that contains Ansible variables and hosts
definitions. In **BlueBanquise**, default path is /etc/bluebanquise/inventory.

Inventory is the **DATA**.

Roles
^^^^^

An Ansible role is a list of tasks to do to achieve a purpose.
For example, there will be a role called dhcp_server, that contains task to
install, configure and start the dhcp server.

In **BlueBanquise**, default path is /etc/bluebanquise/roles.

Note that /etc/bluebanquise/roles is split in multiple directories, but
ansible.cfg file is configured to use roles in all of them.

Roles are the **AUTOMATION LOGIC**.

Playbooks
^^^^^^^^^

An Ansible playbook is simply a list of roles to apply, on a specific host or
group of hosts. It is a yaml file.

In **BlueBanquise**, default path is /etc/bluebanquise/playbooks.

Playbooks are your **LIST OF ROLES TO APPLY on your hosts/targets**.

Variables precedence
--------------------

We are reaching the very important part of the stack.

Ansible has an internal mechanism called **Variables precedence**.
Simply put: you can define the same variables (same name) multiple times, and
using this mechanism, some definitions will have priority above others,
depending of the situation.

When a variable is defined in a yml file, the position of the file in the
ansible inventory is key.

For example, a variable defined in /etc/bluebanquise/inventory/group_vars/all/
will have the less precedence, and a variable defined in
/etc/bluebanquise/inventory/cluster will have a higher precedence, and so win if
loaded.

The full list of available variables precedence is provided in Ansible
documentation:
`variable precedence list <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable>`_

This feature is key to the stack and key for system administrator to manipulate
the **BlueBanquise** stack the way he/she wants, and *force* automatic
values if desired.

For example, values can be set by default, and then redefined for some groups of
hosts without changing the default for all others.
Or it can be used to simply fix a dynamic j2 variable to the desired value in
hosts definitions if dynamic value is not the one expected. Etc.

Inventory can be seen as a giant pizza, in 3D then flatten.

* *Paste* is the variable in /etc/bluebanquise/inventory/group_vars/all
* Then *large ingredients* comes from /etc/bluebanquise/inventory/group_vars/equipment_myequipment
* Then *small ingredients* above are the /etc/bluebanquise/inventory/cluster/nodes/
* And *pepper and tomatoes* (last layer) is the extra-vars at call.

I like pizza...

Replace
-------

Ansible and BlueBanquise default hash_behaviour is *replace*.

If using *replace*, when a dictionary is impacted by the variableâ€™s precedence
mechanism, Ansible overwrite the **full dictionary** if a variable has a higher
precedence somewhere.

If using *merge*, Ansible will only update the related variable, and keep the
original dictionary and values for all other variables in this dictionary.
However, merge is now considered deprecated and is no more default in
BlueBanquise.

Jinja2
------

Jinja2 is the templating language used by Ansible to render templates in roles.
It is heavily used in the stack, and learning Jinja2 will often be needed to
create custom roles.
(But Jinja2 is simple if you are use to code or especially script with bash).

Full documentation is available in a "single page":
`Jinja2 template designer <https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/templates/>`_

Stack vocabulary
================

Icebergs
--------

Icebergs are logical (and often physical) isolation of ethernet management
networks. Most of the time, icebergs are used to:

* Spread load over multiple managements servers (for very large clusters). Icebergs are also often called "islands" in these cases.
* Secure cluster by dividing specific usages, to prevent compromised system to access all the network.

One Iceberg is composed of one or multiple managements servers, **in charge of
the same pool of nodes**.

**BlueBanquise** support many kinds of configurations, but most common are:

One iceberg configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/one_iceberg.svg

For simple systems (small/medium HPC cluster, small enterprise network,
university IT practical session room, etc.), one iceberg scenario is the
standard. One or multiple management will reach the same ethernet administration
networks, and federate the same pool of nodes.

.. image:: images/one_iceberg_example_1.svg

.. image:: images/one_iceberg_example_2.svg


Multiple icebergs configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: images/multiple_icebergs.svg

For advanced systems, (large HPC clusters needing load spreading with unified
network, enterprise network, etc.), multiple icebergs scenario can be required.
**BlueBanquise** allows multiple levels of icebergs, for complex needs.

Manipulating order of network_interfaces defined for each host allows to create
a unified network so all nodes from all icebergs can communicate through this
network (most of the time an Interconnect network).

.. image:: images/multiple_icebergs_example_1.svg

Equipment profiles
------------------

In **BlueBanquise**, nodes are nearly always part of a group starting with
prefix **equipment_**. These groups are called *equipment profiles*.

They are used to provide to hosts of this group the **equipment_profile**
parameters (this includes hosts operating system parameters, kernel parameters,
partitioning, etc.), and other variables if needed like dedicated
authentication parameters.

These are key groups of the stack.

**It is important** to note that equipment_profiles dictionary **must not** be
used at an upper level than group_vars in variables precedence.
**It can, but you must NOT**.
