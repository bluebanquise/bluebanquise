Introduction
============

This documentation has multiple aims.
The first one is to give you an overview of Prometheus and the different exporters.
The second one is to give you instructions on how to add exporters to nodes, and how you could add your own exporters.
The third one is related to alerting configuration.
And the last one is to give an overview of Grafana and the different dashboard.

that's why this documentation will be built around those section:

1. Prometheus
2. Exporters
3. Alerts
4. Grafana
