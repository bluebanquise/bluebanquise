Client
------

Server
------

* Use mmap instead of read/write. This way, we'll benefit from zero copy
  networking in 2.4.x
* number_of_timeout should be per client
* Get ICMP error message
* add maximum number of client for a multicast server thread. Use new thread
  to server the file if needed?
* It may be necessary to free client structure when client is done to make
  sure a long lasting multicast server never build up a huge list of done
  client
* Rate control not working yet.

Both
----
* revise man pages
* add statistics mor mtftp
* Verify the whole logging thing
* Support IPv6
* Decide what to do when we got memory allocation failure (other than exit)
* There is a problem when using block size around 56000 up to 65464. (56944 for
  Glenn McGrath, 64546 for me on linux 2.4 with Debian unstable). Server send
  packets (they are fragmented), client machine receive packet but not the
  application. On an other setup, (linux 2.2.19, Debian 2.2) it work fine up
  to the maximum of 65464.
* When receiving error packet, buffer not beeing initilised with 0 seems to
  create error. String sended by peer to not have proper 0 termination??? Not
  confirmed.

Generic
-------
- Redhat/atftp.spec and test/Makefile are included in make dist and should
  not.
