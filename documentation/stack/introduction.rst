Welcome to BlueBanquise as a stack section.

This documentation is structured as the following:

* Few basic vocabularies, that can help reading this documentation.
* A quick start on how to bootstrap and deploy a very basic cluster with the stack.
* Detailed instructions on how to bootstrap and deploy a cluster, steps by steps.

------------

If you encounter any bugs/issues or have any comments, please inform us.

Note also that since BlueBanquise is a multi-distributions based stack, parts of the
documentation may be dedicated to a specific Linux distribution (always
explicitly mentioned).

We hope you will enjoy this stack as much as we do.

If you need help, do not hesitate to use `the discussions tab <https://github.com/bluebanquise/bluebanquise/discussions>`_
of the project's github.

Next step is to grab few basic :ref:`Vocabulary`.
